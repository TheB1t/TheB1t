# About me

I'm a Software Engineer (yes, just imagine that).

Write code. Break it. Rewrite it better.  
Sometimes structured. Often chaotic.  
No grand mission. Just building things that work (mostly).  
Not interested in hype. Not here to impress.  
If it runs and makes sense, thatâ€™s enough.

## Activity

Irregular. Depends on mood, time, and whether the code fights back.

## Principles

- Minimalism is practical.
- Documentation exists for when memory fails.
- Abstractions are useful, until they're not.
- Code is never finished, only abandoned.

## Stack

Prefer low-level tools and languages (C, C++, ASM, etc).  
Not attached to any specific framework.

## Philosophy

Code should do one thing and do it well.  
If it needs an explanation, it probably wasn't simple enough.

## What you'll find here

- Projects in various states: complete, broken, or forgotten.
- Experiments that may or may not work.
- Occasional documentation (if lucky).

## Abandonware

Some projects here are no longer maintained.  
They might be revived, or not.

## Collaboration

- Open to issues or pull requests if relevant.
- Not interested in pointless discussions.
- Suggestions welcome, debates not required.
